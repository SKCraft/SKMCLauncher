This is outdated
=======================

Status
------

This launcher is no longer maintained due to time constraints. However, the 
launcher lives on as [SKCraft Launcher](https://github.com/skcraft/launcher), 
but it is purely for sending modpacks to clients. It is no longer a general
purpose launcher.
